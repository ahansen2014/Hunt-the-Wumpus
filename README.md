# Hunt-the-Wumpus
Versions of Greg Yob's 1972 text adventure.  Used as teaching aids for my programming classes.

Hunt the Wumpus was originally written by Gregory Yob in BASIC while attending the Dartmouth campus of the University of Massachusetts in 1972 or 1973.  Out of frustration with all the grid-based hunting games he had seen, such as Snark, Mugwump and Hurkle, Yob decided to create a map-based game.  Hunt the Wumpus was first published in the People's Computer Company journal Vol. 2, No. 1 in mid 1973, and again in Creative Computing in its October, 1975 issue.  This article was later reprinted in the book The Best of Creative Compting, Volume 1.  Yob later developed Wumpus 2 and Wumpus 3 which offered more hazards and other cave layouts.

Rather than play on a grid or cube, Yob used a dodecahedron for the cave system.  A dodecahedron is a twelve sided platonic solid.  It has hexagonal faces and twenty vertices or corners.  Each vertex is joined to three neightbouring vertices.
